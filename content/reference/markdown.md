# ***Mechanics of Solids - Week 1, Class 1***

> Hello everyone! Your friendly neighbourhood shichi with his frandos here! Here you have the first note for MOS week1, class1. Enjoy it and have fun. If you have stuff to add then you can message me or kpban on discord server of MIT Manipal CO'25.

***Solid mechanics, also known as mechanics of solids*** \- is the branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behaviour of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the action of forces, temperature changes, phase changes, and other external or internal agents.

Now that we know the textbook definition, before moving forwards we will first look at what the difference is between science and engineering.

## ***Difference between science and engineering -***

#### ***What’s the simple definition?***

Science is the body of knowledge that explores the physical and natural world. Engineering is the application of knowledge in order to design, build and maintain a product or a process that solves a problem and fulfils a need (i.e. a technology).

Scientists use the scientific method for their studies. They start questions, they do the research, they form a hypothesis and then confirm that hypothesis and so on. Whereas, it's totally different for engineers. We first define the problem, then we identify the criteria and constraints of such problem and then we solve it. There are lots of different examples of it, some given below.

Here is a funny pic if you still don't understand it -

Some examples are - well basically all the fucking things you use, geniuses.

### ***How important is mechanics in engineering?***

Mechanics is used in most branches of engineering; mechanical design of gears and pulleys, linkages and mechanisms, consumer products which move, machine design (in manufacturing), microelectromechanical systems (in electronics), electromechanical control systems (cross-over between electrical and mechanical engineering), automation and robotics, civil engineering, automotive, aerospace and spacecraft... You get the point, right?

### Classification of Engineering Mechanics

![24a33d9d9170214cd67d33b7b847ebb5.png](../_resources/24a33d9d9170214cd67d33b7b847ebb5.png)

The types of mechanics in the above chart are only parts of Classical Mechanics, college probably forgot that Quantum mechanics is a thing but anyways.

Here I have listen a small definition of all the parts of mechanics with links which take you to their respective sub-disciplines wikipedia page.

- [Fluid Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics), study which deals with the motion of fluids.
- [Statics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics "Statics"), semi-rigid bodies in [mechanical equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_equilibrium "Mechanical equilibrium")
- [Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_%28mechanics%29) \- Study of forces and their effects on motion.
- [Kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics) is a subfield of physics, developed in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), that describes the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_%28physics%29 "Motion (physics)") of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move.
- In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and engineering, [kinetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetics_%28physics%29) is the branch of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") that is concerned with the relationship between motion and its causes, specifically, [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") and [torques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "Torque").
- In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **rigid body** (also known as a **rigid object**) is a solid [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body "Physical body") in which [deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_%28engineering%29 "Deformation (engineering)") is zero or so small it can be neglected. Study of the mechanics of such rigid bodies is called Mechanics of Rigid bodies.
- In [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), deformation refers to the change in size or shape of an object. *Displacements* are the *absolute* change in position of a point on the object. [Mechanics of Deformable bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_%28engineering%29) is the study of such objects.

> Note - Here if there is any topics left, that means that the definition of it or it's information would be contained in one of the links given below. Please go through the links to get a general grasp on these topics.

In this MOS class, we will solely focus on the Mechanics of Rigid Bodies and the Mechanics of Deformable bodies.

These are the topics we will be covering in this course.

### ***Part 1 : Mechanics of Rigid Bodies***

1.  Resultant of concurrent and non-concurrent coplanar forces.
2.  Equilibrium of concurrent and non-concurrent coplanar forces.
3.  Centroid of plane areas.
4.  Moment of Inertia of plane areas.

### ***Part 2: Mechanics of Deformable Bodies***

1.  Simple stresses and strains.
2.  Statically indeterminate problems and thermal stresses.
3.  Stresses due to fluid pressure in thin cylinders.
4.  Concepts of SFD and BMD.

Don't worry about the terms and things, I'll be explaining everything as we go.

There are some reference books provided by the college but I say you search the internet for topics you don't understand in these notes as I will be covering mostly everything. Ok? Just make sure to take a topic and search on it a bit. The internet is the best reference (psst, stop buying books you dumbasses).

### ***Resultant of Concurrent and Non-concurrent coplanar forces -***

This topic would be split up in 4 Lectures and 2 tutorial numerical lectures. Aight?

* * *

### ***Lecture 1 :-***

These are the things we will go through in this lecture -

- Concept of Rigid body.
- Force and it's characteristics.
- Principle of transmissibility.
- Classification of Force System
- Resultant of Coplanar concurrent forces
- Composition of forces
- Resolution of a force
- Rectangular Components of a force
- Sign convention

Now, I will try to explain all of these as best as I think I possibly can, and I'm extremely sorry if I go in too deep in any of the above subject.
